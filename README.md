# Learning NLP Repository

This repository is designed for learning and practicing Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and techniques. It provides an extensive list of Python libraries that cater to various tasks in NLP, such as preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, visualization, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into NLP with this repository, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

1. **Basic Python Knowledge**: Familiarity with Python programming, including data structures, loops, and functions.
2. **Understanding of Machine Learning Concepts**: Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts like classification, regression, and clustering.
3. **Development Environment**: Set up Python 3.8+ on your system.
4. **Libraries and Frameworks**: Install the libraries listed in `requirements.txt` using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **NLP Basics**: Knowledge of tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization is helpful.
6. **Git**: Install Git to clone and manage this repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AjayKumar095/Natural_Language_Processing.git
   ```
