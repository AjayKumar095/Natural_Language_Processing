    "    <p>The primary goal of NLP is to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is meaningful and useful. It bridges the gap between human communication and machine understanding.</p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: blue;\">2. What does \"tokenization\" refer to in text processing?</h3>\n",
    "    <p>Tokenization refers to the process of breaking down text into smaller units, called tokens, which could be words, phrases, or sentences. For example, splitting \"I love NLP\" into [\"I\", \"love\", \"NLP\"].</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: blue;\">3. What is the difference between lemmatization and stemming?</h3>\n",
    "    <p>Stemming reduces a word to its base or root form by cutting off prefixes or suffixes (e.g., \"running\" to \"run\"). Lemmatization does the same but uses vocabulary and grammar rules to return the word to its dictionary form (e.g., \"better\" to \"good\").</p>\n",
